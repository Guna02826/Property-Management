Owners / Investors – ownership percentages, statements, distributions.

Inspection – checklists, photos, compliance logs.

Documents – e-signatures, versioning, secure storage.

Futuristic (but realistic) models

Smart-Device Hub – IoT sensors (locks, thermostats, water leak detectors), automation rules.

Energy & Sustainability Metrics – consumption, carbon data, predictive optimization.

Predictive Maintenance – ML-based asset health scores, failure forecasts.

AI-Assisted Resident Support – context-aware chat, automated triage.

Dynamic Pricing / Yield Management – rent optimization similar to hotel/airline models.

Digital Twin / BIM Data – 3D models, spatial metadata, building system graphs.

Risk & Compliance Engine – anomaly detection, fraud flags, safety thresholds.

Community & Well-being – sentiment, engagement, event participation (yes, this is becoming a thing).
