// ===============================
// Property Hierarchy Structure & Functions
// ===============================

// 1. Portfolio
// - Logical grouping of multiple properties for management and analysis
// - Belongs to a single owner (typically) or organized by management company
// - Provides aggregated analytics, performance metrics, and comparative reporting
// - Enables strategic oversight and portfolio-level decision making
// - Supports property assignment to multiple portfolios for flexible organization

// 2. Property
// - Physical real estate asset (can be single building or complex)
// - Contains one or more buildings (or standalone units for single-family)
// - Tracks ownership, legal entity, tax information, and insurance details
// - Manages property-level amenities, infrastructure, and compliance certificates
// - Provides property-wide financial tracking, occupancy rates, and performance metrics
// - Supports property status tracking (active, inactive, under renovation, for sale, sold)

// 3. Building (Optional - for complexes)
// - Physical structure within a property (for multi-building properties)
// - Contains multiple floors and units
// - Tracks building-specific characteristics, infrastructure, and amenities
// - Manages building-level maintenance, elevators, and common areas
// - Supports building-specific compliance certificates and inspections
// - Optional level - not required for single-building or single-family properties

// 4. Floor (Optional - for multi-story buildings)
// - Level within a building (Ground, 1st, 2nd, Basement, etc.)
// - Contains multiple units, common spaces, and facilities
// - Tracks floor-specific layout, square footage, and infrastructure
// - Manages floor-level amenities and access control
// - Supports floor plan documentation and space allocation
// - Optional level - not required for single-story properties

// 5. Unit / Space
// - Leasable or usable space within property/building/floor
// - Types: Residential Unit, Commercial Unit, Common Space, Amenity Space, Utility Space
// - Tracks unit details (size, type, bedrooms, bathrooms, amenities)
// - Manages lease agreements, tenant assignments, and rent collection
// - Supports unit status tracking (available, occupied, reserved, maintenance, unavailable)
// - Handles unit-specific financials, maintenance history, and documentation

// 6. Sub-Spaces / Components (Optional)
// - Detailed breakdown within units (rooms, parking, storage, balconies)
// - Tracks individual spaces within a unit (living room, kitchen, bedrooms)
// - Manages assigned parking spaces and storage units
// - Supports detailed space documentation and condition tracking
// - Optional level - for advanced space management and detailed tracking

// Supporting Elements (Cross-Level)

// 7. Common Spaces
// - Shared areas within property/building/floor (lobbies, hallways, corridors, stairwells)
// - Tracks location, square footage, maintenance responsibility, and usage restrictions
// - Manages access control, cleaning schedules, and maintenance costs
// - Supports common area factor calculations for commercial leases
// - Can exist at property, building, or floor level

// 8. Amenities
// - Recreational, fitness, social, or service facilities
// - Types: Property-level (pool, gym, clubhouse), Building-level (lobby, rooftop), Unit-level (in-unit features)
// - Tracks access levels, usage rules, operating hours, and capacity
// - Manages booking requirements, fees, and maintenance schedules
// - Supports amenity-specific financial tracking and insurance

// 9. Infrastructure Elements
// - Physical systems and equipment (lifts/elevators, stairs, parking, utilities)
// - Lifts/Elevators: Tracked at building/floor level with maintenance schedules and compliance
// - Parking: Can be property-level (parking lot) or unit-level (assigned spaces)
// - Utilities: Meters, HVAC systems, electrical panels tracked separately
// - Manages maintenance schedules, service contracts, and compliance certificates

// 10. Parking Spaces
// - Individual parking spots (covered, uncovered, garage, street)
// - Tracks assignment to units/tenants, fees, and accessibility features
// - Manages parking space dimensions, type, and EV charging availability
// - Supports parking fee collection and space reservation
// - Can be standalone or assigned to specific units

// Hierarchy Flow:
// Portfolio → Property → Building (optional) → Floor (optional) → Unit → Sub-Spaces (optional)
// 
// Supporting elements (Common Spaces, Amenities, Infrastructure, Parking) can exist at multiple levels
// and are linked to the appropriate parent level (Property, Building, Floor, or Unit)
