Create a new file Requirements/Data Model & Entities.txt containing:
1) Core entities (Portfolio, Property, Unit, Tenant, Lease, Payment, Work Order, User, Role) with must-have attributes (mark required vs optional).
2) Entity relationships (cardinality and join tables).
3) MVP workflows (tenant onboarding, rent payment, maintenance request→work order, lease creation/renewal, property/unit setup) with steps and involved roles.
