## Recommended Focus Areas for Internship

### High Priority (Must Plan)
1. **Core Data Model** - Essential entities and relationships
2. **MVP Features** - What to build first
3. **Database Schema** - How to store data
4. **Key Workflows** - Main user journeys
5. **Technology Stack** - What to use

### Medium Priority (Should Plan)
6. **API Design** - How frontend/backend communicate
7. **UI Screens** - What screens are needed
8. **Authentication** - How users log in
9. **Basic Permissions** - Who can do what

### Low Priority (Can Plan Later)
10. **Advanced Features** - Nice-to-have features
11. **Integrations** - External services (can be basic)
12. **Advanced Reporting** - Beyond basic reports
